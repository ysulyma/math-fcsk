# math-fcsk

This repository contains source code for interactive versions of the figures in my paper [Floor, ceiling, slopes, and K-theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04978). It is hosted at https://ysulyma.github.io/papers/fcsk/.

## Installation

You will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Once you do, clone this repository and run the following commands:
```bash
git@github.com:ysulyma/math-fcsk.git
cd math-fcsk
npm install
```
Once you have done this, run
```bash
npm run dev
```
and open your browser with the URL it gives you.

## Code

This is a React app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). If you are unfamiliar with web development, you will need to learn the following technologies:

1. [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
2. [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) (less important)
3. [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
4. [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/)
5. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) (less important)

You should learn them *in this order*, although you don't have to master any of these (which is impossible) before starting the nextâ€”just make sure you have the basic concepts. A lot of confusions I see come from not understanding the boundaries between these technologies.
